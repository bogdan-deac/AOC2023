# AOC2023

Advent of code 2023 solved using haskell

## Day1

### Part1

Easy, just some function composition.

### Part 2

Could probably have done it in a cleaner way, but I wanted to use Parsec.

## Day 2

Pretty simple, but probably could have done it in a cleaner fashion.

## Day 3

Probably the most difficult one so far, but array manipulation in haskell is tough.
Didn't bother using Vector or things like that.
